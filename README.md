# Simple Svelte CAGR Calculator

Well I needed to caclculate some compound anual growth rate and the ones on google were
pretty terrible. So why not build a svelte app?

Svelte is pretty cool, seems very similar to Vue in a lot of ways. Would use again.

In my experience Vue breaks down when you are needing to attach listeners to complex data
changes elsewhere in the app. At onX, building a robust geospatial app in Vue stretched
the limits of the Vue binding engine and it _may_ have been more useful to be in an ecosystem
like React/Redux which IMO can more gracefully handle the propagation of data changes.

I am curious how similar large-data situations would be handled in Svelte.
